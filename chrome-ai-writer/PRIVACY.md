# Privacy Policy — AI Writing Assistant

**Last updated:** February 24, 2026

## What data we collect

AI Writing Assistant does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to us. We have no servers, no analytics, and no tracking.

The extension stores the following settings locally on your device using chrome.storage.local:

- API endpoint URL
- API key
- Model name

These settings never leave your device and are not synced across devices.

## What data is sent to third parties

When you send a message in the chat dialog, the following data is sent to your configured API endpoint (e.g., OpenAI, AliCloud DashScope, or any provider you choose):

- Your chat message
- Up to 10 previous messages in the current conversation
- The current content of the active text field (if under 4,000 characters)

This data is sent directly from your browser to the API endpoint you configured. We do not proxy, intercept, or store any of this data. The handling of your data by the API provider is governed by their own privacy policy.

## What data we share

None. We have no access to your data and share nothing with any party.

## Data storage

All extension settings are stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API. No data is stored remotely.

## Changes to this policy

If this policy is updated, the changes will be posted to this page with an updated date.
